Control Sequence Introducer (CSI) = ESC+[ = \x1B] = \x9B

SGR - Select Graphic Rendition
  CSI n [;k] m
  Sets SGR parameters, including text color. After CSI can be zero
  or more parameters separated with ';'. With no parameters, CSI m is
  treated as CSI 0 m (reset / normal), which is typical of most of
  the ANSI escape sequences.
